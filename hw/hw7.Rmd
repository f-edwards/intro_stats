## Homework 7; practice with regression

```{r include = F}
library(tidyverse)
ipv<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f-edwards/intro_stats/master/data/dhs_ipv.csv")
```

1. Estimate a regression with beat_burnfood as the outcome and no_media as the predictor. Interpret the coefficients.

2. Compute the expected value of beat_burnfood when no_media = 50 (you can do this manually, or with the predict() function)

3. Compute the expected value of beat_burnfood when no_media = 90 

4. Compare these findings. Interpret their meaning substantively (in reference to the theoretical question, not just the numbers themselves.)
