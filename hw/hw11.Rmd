1. Using IPUMS and the 2023 ACS (one year) sample, create a pull with the following variables: INCTOT (person level, income), EDUC (person level, education), UHRSWORK (person level, work), and AGE (person level, demographic)

2. Explain in plain language a basic theory for how education, age, and hours of work relate to income. 

3. Write a regression equation to operationalize your theory explained in (2)

4. Estimate that regression model. Interpret the coefficients, describe whether estimates are statistically significant, and describe the precision of your estimates (as 95 percent confidence intervals for Beta estimates)

5. Visualize your findings by using predict to generate expected values. Interpret this visual with at least 3-4 sentences.
