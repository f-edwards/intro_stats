In this homework, we'll practice fitting and comparing regression models

Use the ACS data we've been working with in class

```{r}
dat<-read_csv("https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/acs12.csv")
```

We will build a model to predict hrs_work. 

1. Using the variables available in the data, draw a DAG to summarize your theory on what might cause variation in hours worked

2. Fit a model with only additive terms that represents your theory. Explain what the parameters mean and interpret statistical significance. 
3. Now, fit a model that includes at least one interaction. Explain what the parameters mean. 

4. Compare these models using $R^2$ and BIC. What do you find?

5. Visualize the regression model against the observed data. Any concerns?

6. Consider other model specifications and repeat 4-5

7. Which model do you prefer? Why?
