1. Read Chapter 2 of Kieran Healy's Data Visualization (available for free here: https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#gettingstarted)

2. Confirm you have the needed packages installed by loading the `tidyverse` package. Install (if needed) and load the `gapminder` package

3. Create a new variable in the tibble `gapminder` called `pop1000` that is equal to the population of a country in 1,000s of people (`pop/1000`).

4. Compute the mean life expectancy for all observations in the dataset

5. Use the `unique()` function to list all of the countries with observations in the `gapminder` tibble. 

6. Create a scatterplot (using ggplot) showing `lifeExp` on the y axis and `gdpPercap` on the x axis. Provide a brief interpretation of your plot.

7. Reproduce the plot from 6, but instead, plot `log(gdpPercap)` on the x axis. Provide a brief interpretation of your plot.
