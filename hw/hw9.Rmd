```

This assignment uses the polls08 data from the qss library

Compute quantities of interest using all poll results for the following states: {MI, NM, WI, CA, NY, NJ, ME}

- Visualize the distribution of poll results for each candidate in each of these states (histograms or densities are most appropriate)

- Compute the average poll result $\bar{x}$ for each state for both Obama and McCain support

- Compute the variance of poll results for each candidate and each state


- Compute a 90 percent confidence interval for each candidate and each state



- Describe each candidate's likely vote total as a margin of error with your 90 \% interval for each state

- For each state, conduct the following hypothesis test at the $\alpha = 0.05$ threshold: 


$$H_0: \mu_{Obama} - \mu_{McCain} = 0 $$

- What do these tests tell you?
