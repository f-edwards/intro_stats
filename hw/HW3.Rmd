Read Open Intro to Statistics Chapter 3

Complete the following exercises: 

3.1 - 3.12; 3.13 - 3.22

You can complete your homework either on paper (to be turned in during class), in R with code comments, or in a regular word processor.

## 3.1

a) False. This is the gambler's fallacy, next flid will be heads, they are independent
b) False. There are red cards that are face cards.
c) True. Aces are not face cards.

## 3.2

a) 18/38 = 0.47
b) 18/38 - 0.47 
c) I suspect an unfair wheel in b) because 300 reds in a row is incredibly unlikely! p = 0.47^ 300 ~ 0

## 3.3 

a) 10 flips, much more likely to see a 0.6 with a small sample
b) 100, very likely to see value near 0.5 with large sample
c) 100, less deviation in mean for large sample
d) 10, greater chance of extreme sample with small sample

## 3.4

1/6 * 1/6 = 1/6 * 1/6; equal probability of any two exact combinations

## 3.5

a) 0.5^10 = 0.001 
b) 0.5^10 = 0.001
c) 1 - 0.5^10 = 0.999

## 3.6

a) 0; no combinations can produce this value
b) of 36 possible combinations: 2:3; 3:2, 1:4; 4:1; so 4/36 = 0.11
c) 6:6; 1/36 = 0.028

## 3.7

n = 2373; p(independent) = 0.35; p(swing) = 0.23; p(independent, swing) = 0.11

a) no, they aren't disjoint because the joint probability is greater than 0
b) imagine intersecting circles here
c) P(independent|swing = 0); P(independent) - p(independent, swing = 1) = 0.24
d) P(independent or swing) = P(independent) + P(swing) - P(independent, swing) = 0.47
e) 1 - 0.47 = 0.53
f) No; p(independent, swing) != p(swing)p(independent)

## 3.8 

p(poor) = 0.146; p(language) = 0.207; p(poor, language) = 0.042

a) No, p(poor, language) > 0
b) circles!
c) p(poor, !language) = p(poor) - p(poor, language) = 0.146 - 0.042 = 10.4 percent
d) p(poor or language) = p(poor) + p(language) - p(poor, language) = 0.146 + 0.207 - 0.042 = 31.1 percent
e) p(!poor, !language) = 1 - p(poor or language) = 0.689
f) p(poor)p(language) < p(poor, language), not independent

## 3.9

a) independent (assuming no curve)
b) neither
c) no 

## 3.10

a) p(wrong)^4 * p(right); (3/4)^4 * (1/4) = 0.08
b) p(right)^5 = 0.25^5 = 0.001
c) 1 - p(wrong^5) = 1 - 0.75^5 = 0.76

## 3.11

a) 0.16 + 0.09 = 0.25
b) 0.17 + 0.09 = 0.26
c) assuming education is independent of marriage partner selection; 0.25 * 0.26 = 0.065.
d) No; definitely not reasonable. assortative mating is well documented

## 3.12

a) 1 - (0.25 + 0.15 + 0.28) = 0.32
b) 0.25 + 0.32 = 0.57
c) 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.28 = 0.68
d) assuming independence (unlikely) 0.32 * 0.32 = 0.10
e) assuming independence (unlikely) 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.46
f) nope, not reasonable

## 3.13

a) yes if assuming independence; 0.3 * 0.7; no otherwise
b) 
  i) 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21 
  ii) P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.3 + 0.7 - 0.21 = 0.79
  iii) P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.3
c) No, because 0.1 != 0.21
d) P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.1 / 0.7 = 0.143

## 3.14 

p(j|pb) = p(pb and j) / p(pb) = 0.975

## 3.15

a) No, 0.18 of respondents fall into this combination.
b) P(earth is warming or liberal Democrat) =
= P(earth is warming) + P(liberal Democrat) - P(earth is warming and liberal Democrat) = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.18 = 0.62
c) P(earth is warming | liberal Democrat) = 0.18/0.20 = 0.9
d) P(earth is warming | conservative Republican) = 0.11/0.33 = 0.33
(e) No, the two appear to be dependent. 
f) P(moderate/liberal Republican | not warming) = 0.06/0.34 = 0.18

## 3.16

a) No, there are individuals who are both excellent in health and have health coverage.
b) P(excellent health) = 0.2329
c) P(excellent health | health coverage) = 0.2099 / 0.8738 = 0.24
d) P(excellent health | no health coverage) = 0.0230 / 0.1262 = 0.18
e) No, because the probability that a person has excellent health varies between the two health coverage categories (24% vs 18%). 

## 3.17

a) No; there are women who like 5 guys
b) 162 / 248 = 0.65
c) 181 / 252 = 0.72
d) assuming independence 0.65 * 0.72 = 0.47
e) P(Umami or female) = P(Umami) + P(female) - P(Umami and female) = (6+ 252âˆ’1) / 500 = 0.514.

## 3.18

a) P(man or partner has blue eyes) = (108 + 114 - 78) / 204 = 0.7059
b) P(partner with blue eyes | man with blue eyes) = 78 / 114 = 0.6842
c) P(partner with blue eyes | man with brown eyes) = 19 / 54 = 0.3519
P(partner with blue eyes | man with green eyes) = 11 / 36 = 0.3056
d) It is much more likely for a man with blue eyes to have a partner with blue eyes than a man with another eye color to have a partner with blue eyes. Therefore it appears that eye colors of males and their partners are not independent.

## 3.19

a) pretty tree diagram here!
b) P(can construct | pass) = P(pass and can construct)/ P(pass) = 0.84

## 3.20

a) pretty tree diagram here!
b)  (pre | positive) = P (pre and positive) / P (positive)
= 0.0297 / (0.0297 + 0.0194)
= 0.6049

## 3.21 

a) pretty tree diagram here!
b) P (lupus|positive) = P (lupus and positive) / P (positive)
= 0.0196 /  (0.0196 + 0.2548)
= 0.0714

## 3.22

a) pretty tree diagram here!
b)
