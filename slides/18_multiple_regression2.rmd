## The linear regression model

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon \] \pause

$\beta_0$: The value of $y$ when $x$ is equal to zero \pause

$\beta_1$: The average increase in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit \pause

$\varepsilon$: The distance between the line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ and the actual observed values of $y$. Allows us to estimate the line, even when x and y do not fall exactly on a line. \pause

## Data for today

```{r size = "tiny"}
dat<-read_csv("https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/acs12.csv")
glimpse(dat)
```

## Let's look at income for this ACS 2012 sample

```{r fig.height = 4, size = "tiny"}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

## OK, what could cause variation in income? 

```{r}
glimpse(dat)
```

## Visual checks

Causation requires association (though it's not always unconditional!). Looks promising here!

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(y = income, x = age)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

## Visual checks

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~race, scales = "free_y")
```

## Visual checks

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~gender, scales = "free_y")
```

## Visual checks

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~edu, scales = "free_y")
```



## Visual checks

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat,
       aes(x = income, y = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Let's build a **causal model** to formalize what we think causes variation in income across the population. \pause

To do this, we'll use *Directed Acyclic Graphs*, or *DAGs* for short.

## Let's start with a simple model

Based on our deep scientific knowledge we suspect that *hours worked* $t$ has direct effects on *income* $I$

```{r fig.height = 2}
library(dagitty)
d1<-dagitty("dag {
            t->I
            t [exposure]
            I [outcome]
            }") 
plot(graphLayout(d1))
```

## Basic features of a DAG

DAGs contain *nodes* that represent variables, and *edges* that represent causal relationships between variables. In this case, we have two nodes, hours worked and income, and one edge, representing the effect of time spent working on income. 

```{r fig.height = 2, size = "tiny"}
plot(graphLayout(d1))
```

## Basic features of a DAG

DAGs compactly represent our theoretical models. What is the theory presented here and do we believe it is adequate?

```{r fig.height = 2, size = "tiny", echo = F}
plot(graphLayout(d1))
```

## Adding complexity

Let's add level of education to our model. What theoretical relationships does this model suggest? 

```{r fig.height = 2}
d2<-dagitty("dag {
            E->I
            t->I
            E [exposure]
            I [outcome]
            }") 

plot(graphLayout(d2))
```

## The importance of theory

Which model is more plausible? 

```{r fig.height = 2, echo = T}
d3<-dagitty("dag {
            E->I
            t->I
            E->t
            E [exposure]
            I [outcome]
            }") 

plot(graphLayout(d3))
```

## Confounding

We cannot obtain a valid estimate of the effect of $t$ on $I$ if DAG 3 is correct, unless we adjust for $E$. 

This is a case of *confounding*. A relationship between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is confounded when a third variable $Z$ also causes $X$ and $Y$. 

```{r fig.height = 2, echo = F}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(graphLayout(d2))
plot(graphLayout(d3))
```

## Let's try it: unconditional linear relationship

```{r}
m0<-lm(income ~ hrs_work,
       data = dat)
summary(m0)
```

## Let's try it: additive linear relationship

```{r}
m1<-lm(income ~ hrs_work + 
         edu,
       data = dat)
summary(m1)
```

## Multiple regression (regression with more than 1 predictor)

We can generalize the linear regression 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$$
$$varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$ \pause

as 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 \cdots \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon\]
\[\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

Where $k$ is the number of predictor variables we include in the model. Our only constraint is that $k$ must be smaller than the number of observations $n$ in our data. 

## Our model for income

Our theoretical model tells us that if we want to learn about $t \rightarrow I$, we must adjust for the effects that $E$ has on both $t$ and $I$. 

We tried this with the model:

$$E(\textrm{income}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{hrs} + \beta_2 \textrm{edu}$$
(Keep in mind that `edu` is going to be treated as the number of categories in the variable - 1 extra parameters). 

## Interpreting this model

```{r size = "tiny"}
table(dat$edu)
summary(m1)
```

## To understand what the model says, let's visualize y-hat

```{r size = "tiny"}
# set up prediction data with values of interest
hrs_work<-0:60
edu<-c("college", "hs or lower", "grad")
pred_dat<-expand_grid(hrs_work, edu)
# generate expected values and CI, join pred_dat
e_y<-predict(m1, 
             newdata = pred_dat,
             interval = "confidence") |> 
  bind_cols(pred_dat)
# inspect
head(e_y)
```

## Visualizing model expectations

```{r fig.height = 4, size = "tiny"}
ggplot(e_y,
       aes(y = fit,
           ymin = lwr,
           ymax = upr,
           x = hrs_work,
           fill = edu,
           color = edu)) + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line() 
```

## Multiple regression basics

1. Categorical predictors act as intercepts, or differences in level
2. Continuous predictors act as slopes

## Regression with more than one slope and multiple intercepts

Maybe we think age also plays a role. Let's assume this causal model, where $A$ is age. Now, we have to condition on $A$ and $E$ to close all *back door* paths between $t$ and $I$ and adjust for confounding

```{r fig.height = 2}
d4<-dagitty("dag {
            E->I
            t->I
            E->t
            A->I
            A->t
            A->E
            t [exposure]
            I [outcome]
            }") 

plot(graphLayout(d4))
```

## Estimating the model

$$E(\textrm{income}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{hrs} + \beta_2 \textrm{edu} + \beta_3 \textrm{age}$$

```{r}
m2<-lm(income ~ hrs_work + 
         edu + 
         age,
       data = dat)
tidy(m2)
```

## Visualizing model expectations: setup

```{r size = "tiny"}
# set up prediction data with values of interest
hrs_work<-c(0:60)
age<-c(18:65)
edu<-c("college", "hs or lower", "grad")
pred_dat<-expand_grid(hrs_work, edu, age)
# generate expected values and CI, join pred_dat
e_y<-predict(m2, 
             newdata = pred_dat,
             interval = "confidence") |> 
  bind_cols(pred_dat)
# inspect
head(e_y)
```

## Visualizing model expectations

```{r echo = F}
p1<-ggplot(e_y |> 
             filter(age == 35),
       aes(y = fit,
           ymin = lwr,
           ymax = upr,
           x = hrs_work,
           fill = edu,
           color = edu)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(subtitle = "Age 35") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,120000))

p2<-ggplot(e_y |> 
             filter(hrs_work == 40),
       aes(y = fit,
           ymin = lwr,
           ymax = upr,
           x = age,
           fill = edu,
           color = edu)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(subtitle = "40 hours per week")+ 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,120000))

p1 + p2 + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
```

## The difference between a DAG and a specification

This DAG can help us theorize how to adjust our models, but it does not tell us the correct regression specification. Is the relationship between $A$ and $I$ linear? 

```{r fig.height = 2}
d4<-dagitty("dag {
            E->I
            t->I
            E->t
            A->I
            A->t
            A->E
            t [exposure]
            I [outcome]
            }") 

plot(graphLayout(d4))
```

## Adding complexity: quadratic terms

We know that earnings for people less than age 18 and greater than age 70 tend to be very low (or zero). We can try to use a parabola (a quadratic equation) to model this process. 

Quadratics take a form that looks like this

```{r fig.height = 4}
x<- -100:100
y<- 5 + 2 * x + x^2
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

## Adding complexity: negative sign

```{r fig.height = 4}
x<- -100:100
y<- 5 + 2 * x - x^2
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

## Fitting a quadratic term

We use the I() function to require R to evaluate math statements inside formula objects

```{r}
m3<-lm(income ~ hrs_work + 
         edu +
         age + 
         I(age^2),
       data = dat)
tidy(m3)
```

## Visualizing model expectations

```{r echo = F}
# set up prediction data with values of interest
hrs_work<-c(0:60)
age<-c(18:65)
edu<-c("college", "hs or lower", "grad")
pred_dat<-expand_grid(hrs_work, edu, age)
# generate expected values and CI, join pred_dat
e_y<-predict(m3, 
             newdata = pred_dat,
             interval = "confidence") |> 
  bind_cols(pred_dat)
# inspect
head(e_y)

ggplot(e_y |> 
             filter(hrs_work == 40),
       aes(y = fit,
           ymin = lwr,
           ymax = upr,
           x = age,
           fill = edu,
           color = edu)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(subtitle = "40 hours per week")+ 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,120000))
```
